        <ul>
          <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
          <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
          <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
          <li>1 cup grated mozzarella cheese</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>- Steps -</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
          <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until it is browned and crumbled. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
          <li>Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.</li>
          <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes (if using). Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 10-15 minutes, or until it has thickened slightly.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
          <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 3 noodles on top of the sauce. Spread 1/2 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese over the top. Repeat this process with 2 more layers of noodles, sauce, ricotta, and mozzarella.</li>
          <li>For the final layer, arrange the remaining 3 noodles on top of the sauce. Spread the remaining meat sauce over the noodles, and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.</li>
          <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
          <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
